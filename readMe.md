This is the first project I am building outside of my CS degree curriculum. It's an information/menu/goods website for a local coffee shop in my town. At the time of the first commit a lot has already been built locally by me on VSCode.

The project is a front-end focused project with what will probably end up being a static website hosted by a web-hosting service. I have built the website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript, alongside few lines of JQuery to execute my design for the website. Everything was coded by myself except two third-party libraries were used for certain functions: ScrollCue by SamWest (https://github.com/prjct-samwest/scrollCue) and swiper.js.

Thank you for taking interest in this project! Please check out the website.
